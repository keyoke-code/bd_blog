When we started BitDiamond we wrote down our principles. Nothing flashy, just some things we could check back on when things got tough. Or indeed when things went well! Crypto is high adrenaline, there are lots of distractions, lots of people think they know what should come next. Maybe they do, but if you don't have a really clear idea of your OWN principles you can end up chasing every shiny thing you see... So, we wanted to be clear on our ours for the beginning.

We hadn't checked in on them in a while. Things got busy. But when we did we realised we maybe weren't hitting number three as well as we could. Hence this blog post. Let's walk through our principles and then we can fill you in on **_exactly_** where we are.

## Principles

There are lots of quotes out there on principles. I quite like the above one. So what are **our** princples:

1) To be the safest token we could possibly be.

This told us where to start. We would need a great audit so we were sure there were no mistakes or exploits hiding in our code. It means we needed to put as much USD in liquidity as we could afford. It means we needed to load as many BTDMD into liquidity as we could. It means we won't engage in any marketing that might see an unsustainable surge in price (resulting in a later crash). It meant we would pick our strategic partners carefully. We remember this one every day.

2) To always put **holders** first.

This seems obvious but not all tokens operate this way. Essentially, this means we will never pursue new holders at the expense of **existing** holders. Never. That can be applied in straightforward ways, for example not airdropping the token. That's giving away something that someone has already paid something for. That's not fair. It can also relate to how we spend our team funds. Marketing or roadmap, a new youtube partnership or a smart contract audit? Sometimes a course of action is obviously good for everyone. But if there is any doubt, existing holders come first.

3) To be the most transparent crypto in the world.

We do pretty well here I think, but this is the one that we realised needed some work. Part of meeting this one is our blog. Our 'Staying SAFU' and 'Cryptobits' articles are trying to give something back and also be transparent with our community. Another part is our roadmap where we set out our goals. But I reckon we can do more here in terms of letting people know exactly what the team is working on. 

So here goes!

## What are we doing?

First of all a caveat - this is what we are currently working on. It **doesn't** mean these plans won't change. If we see an opportunity, or if something doesn't seem the right time, we will alter our plans. Also bear in mind that we are letting you in here. Most of this we won't release to the market until we are SURE of when and how it will go live. So welcome in, but remember that caveat :).

### Exchanges

We are in discussions with three exchanges at the moment.
