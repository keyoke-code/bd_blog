If you haven't already, take a read of our [first post, where we invented the world's most limited time machine](https://blog.btdmd.com/post/top/). This gave us the opportunity to travel through time and go head to head with bitcoin. So, how are we doing?

## When are we?

We capitalised BitDiamond to a unit price around the price that bitcoin was in that pizza purchase back in 2010. So at launch our 'when' moment was May 22 2010. At this very moment we are at $0.0295 per BitDiamond, so how does that compare?

Precise historical bitcoin data is surprisingly hard to come by, but we do know that in July 2010 we had one of bitcoin's first pumps, going from $0.008 at the start of July to $0.08 by the end of July. So we are going to call $0.03 as being somewhere mid July 2010.
