If you haven't already, take a read of our [first post, where we invented the world's most limited time machine](https://blog.btdmd.com/post/top/). This gave us the opportunity to travel through time and go head to head with bitcoin. So, how are we doing?

## When are we?

We capitalised BitDiamond to the same unit price that bitcoin was in that pizza purchase back in 2010. So at launch our 'when' moment was May 22 2010. At this very moment we are at $0.0295 per BitDiamond, so how does that compare to bitcoin's growth?

Precise historical bitcoin data is surprisingly hard to come by, but we do know that in July 2010 we had one of bitcoin's first pumps, going from $0.008 at the start of July to $0.08 by the end of July. So we are going to call $0.0295 as being somewhere around early to mid July 2010. Let's pick July 12.

So, this first round goes to BitDiamond! The price increase we've achieved in nine days took bitcoin 51 days. We'll check back in a week or so and see where we are at.

**When are we in our bitcoin time machine?** July 12 2010.

**Who's in the lead?** BitDiamond, by 42 days
