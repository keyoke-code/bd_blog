We've been live for a month. Well, nearly. I had planned to write a retrospective piece covering the last month but that can wait. I want to talk about the future!

## Roadmap

When we launched we published a roadmap. This was always a short-term roadmap, intended to get us going. And in the past month we've ticked off the items. Here is how it looks now:

So we are getting to the end of 'Phase 1'. But what is phase 1?

## Three Phases

We've planned out three phases for BitDiamond:

* Phase 1: Establish. Get the token live and out to holders.
* Phase 2: Differentiate. There are lots of tokens out there, and more launching every week. Pretty much all of them have some tokenomics that offer appeal. What relatively few have is a project that surrounds the token and the offer of utility. This is about adding value.
* Phase 3: Capitalize. If we have done our job right in phase 2 this is where we can capitalize on that effort and see our price rise to match our value.

So we are now moving into phase 2. What does that mean?

## Phase 2

Phase 2 is all about building the infrastructure that will surround our core token and provide that utility and value. This phase is where BitDiamond transforms for a store of value with good tokenomics to a store of value with good tokenomics AND a utility token with real world use cases and the ability to generate positive cash flows. It's the cornerstone of a project, an ecosystem if you will. Not an end goal in itself. This phase is where we work through out plans to turn BitDiamond into a token with an MCAP in the 100s of millions. But to do that we've got work ahead of us!
