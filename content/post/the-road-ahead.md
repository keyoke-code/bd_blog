We've been live for a month. Well, nearly. I had planned to write a retrospective piece covering the last month but that can wait. I want to talk about the future!

## Roadmap

When we launched we published a roadmap. This was always a short-term roadmap, intended to get us going. And in the past month we've ticked off the items. Here is how it looks now:

So we are getting to the end of 'Phase 1'. But what is phase 1?

## Phases

We've planned out three phases for BitDiamond:

Phase 1: Establish. Get the token live and out to holders.

Phase 2: Differentiate. There are lots of tokens out there, and more launching every week. Pretty much all of them have some tokenomics that offer appeal. What relatively few have is a project that surrounds the token and the offer of utility.

Phase 3: Capitalise.
