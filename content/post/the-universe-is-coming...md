Dear neglected blog,

I've been away for a long time. I know, I'm sorry. But I had code to write, and review, and test. I don't mind doing that. In fact, I'm pretty good at it. But, the truth is, I've missed you. Code is OK, but I crave PROSE! If this goes on much longer I may even want poetry. . .

But we are getting closer. The universe is coming. And by that I mean the BitDiamond Universe! I think about all our loyal holders of BitDiamond and I smile the biggest smile. They believe in this project, but even they don't know how BIG this could be! ABC. Always be creating! Well, we'll wrap up our Phase 2, get the dapps and tokens deployed, and then I can spend time talking to people and writing.

Can't wait! :)

Bradley
